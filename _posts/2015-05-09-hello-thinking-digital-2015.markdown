title: "Hello, Thinking Digital 2015!"
---

I'm on the way to [Thinking Digital](http://www.thinkingdigital.co.uk) and getting excited about what sounds like an incredible event.

This was made possible by their Emerging Talent Fund, through which I was fortunate enough to win a free ticket. Thanks again to the supporters who made that possible.

If we've just met, I'm an Engineer who loves building things that improve the world and that my customers love.

I'm passionate about building things, renewable energy, social equality, democracy, citizen empowerment, open source & collaboration and many other things.

If any of that sounds interesting, [let's talk](/contact)!
